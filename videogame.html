        <p>I used to play on the Playstation 4, but then I realized that paying for a subscription for online multiplayer was a monetary sink. So I switched to PC. I started with First Person Shooters and eventually moved into third person and eventually roleplaying games.<br>Part of my interest in computer science started with videogames. I understood that games were programmed as they were typically digital and got me to start learning C#.</p>
