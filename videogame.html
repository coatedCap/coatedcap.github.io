        <p>I used to play on the Playstation 4, but then I realized that paying for a subscription for online multiplayer was a monetary sink. So I switched to PC.<br>I started with First Person Shooters and eventually moved into third person and eventually roleplaying games.<br>Part of my interest in computer science started with videogames.<br>I understood that games were programmed as they were typically digital and got me to start learning C#.<br>I'm currently thinking of a new project involving the online messaging platform Discord and a bot user that will serve as an information terminal for a roleplaying game system.</p>
