This website repository project has been coded and developed for the sole purpose of the **Western Washington Univserity CSCI 202 Final Project** hosted by Dustin O'Hara.  
The content of the project may bear similarities to other properties. Such properties are inspirations and notes about their design have been adopted.  
Any naming or seemingly representative names of people. events or objects are of pure coincidence.  

**No dedicated considerations for optimizations or better frameworks were considered during this project.**  

Final Project
=============

This README.md primarily regards the project contained within the FinalPush folder.  
The disclaimer above is in regards to this project.  

The Final Project, which will be referred to as Tunel of Asplen Demo (ToAD), is the beginning of a text-based adventure concept.
The extended vision of this project would be a "roguelite/rogue-like" where the map lengths and rooms are randomized. For ToAD, the map and room events have been pre-determined.
The scope of such a vision exceeded the bounds and expectations set by the developer (coatedCap/Jeremy) and was thusly pulled back.  

The main focus of this project was utilizing JavaScript (mainly), JQuery and interacting with DOM Objects. For this project, the primary focus was on a text terminal.  
This text terminal exists in the form of a textarea with the value being modified as the game progresses. To the developer's surprise, this textarea was readable by a screenreader and was able to read updated text.
However, the developer has not actually experienced the text reader themselves. Some data of the project is stored in multiple JSONs.

_Has the minimum viable product been delivered?_      **Yes.**  
_Any code inefficiencies?_      **Definitely.**  
_If you were to spend more time on this, what would you change?_  
- **Allocate more defined functions to reduce code and redundant writing.**
- **Add more descriptive lines within the text terminal to describe current situations.**
- **Implement the the original scope and other pages for the project.**
- **More loose image visuals to add more immersion beyond the text only format.**
