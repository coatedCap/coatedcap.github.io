        <h2><a href="index.html">Jeremy Tran</a><br>CS202 - Assignment 1</h2><br>
        <p>I used to be part of <a href="cap.html">Civil Air Patrol</a>. I was volunteering as a crossing guard for the Arlington Fly-In 2019 event which is essentially an airshow that takes place at Arlington Municipal Airport (AWO).<br>I was pulled aside to join on an Orientation Ride (O-Ride).<br>I was seated with a senior pilot and I was placed in the co-pilot seat in a Cessna 182 which is a powered single engine aircraft.<br>The Civil Air Patrol teaches situational awareness which meant I had to keep an active eye on environment, weather conditions and the instrument panel.<br>
        At some point, we flew about 3 minutes over the Canadian-American border before making our way back to AWO.<br>My senior pilot and I were then told that a Canadian Air Traffic Control Tower attempted to hail us, but we had turned around by then. Luckily, they assumed we were from the Arlington event.<br></p>
