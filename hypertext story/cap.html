        <p>From around 2012 to 2018, I took part in Civil Air Patrol. It is an auxiliary civilian branch of the United States Air Force which aimed to grow effective leaders for the future.<br>Without going into a long description, it is a more militaristic Boy Scouts that has access to aircraft, can perform Search and Rescue missions and aerial surveys.<br>Of course, it can also provide a smoother pathing into the USAF Academy or other military branches thanks to following a similar ranking path as the actual airforce.<br>I used to lead my squadron's Alpha flight as a Flight Sergeant which meant I had to teach cadets to become better at their drills and groupwork skills.<br><br>When I first joined, I was soft spoken and didn't really want to be there. However, over time I learned to speak louder and learned many soft skills that have helped me in more ways than I can imagine.</p><br>
