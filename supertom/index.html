                We've confirmed the existence of orbital stations around E4-R7H. We have established surface level system connections to their databases and staff rosters.<br>The tech team is currently working on acquiring more information, but they don't seem to have any imposing or threatening armaments deployed to orbit yet.<br>
                The information can be reached through the connection terminal below.
