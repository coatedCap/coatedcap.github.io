        <p>Overview:<br><br>
            An in-browser minigame built off HTML, CSS, and a flexible backend.<br>
            The game will be a fixed, but randomized dungeon crawler with card combat.<br>
            To give a more clear genre definition, this will take after the roguelite style and would resemble games such as Slay the Spire and Inscryption.<br>
            The entire game is meant to be played in one sitting which means there will likely be no save system in place for this project. The game is meant to be played on a browser, but mobile support will be looked into towards the end of the development cycle.<br>
            Image graphics are unlikely to be included, but text descriptions will be provided. The ideal is to have simple graphics that will present easy information with the ability to see more detailed text on hover over or clicking.
            The focus of this project is primarily to study the back-end development and experiment on how much load can be placed on the coding aspect. It is likely that Javascript will be used as the simple fallback, but hopefully ASP.NET or a similar language can be used. JSON files will be used to store the main data for the game.<br>
            This project also serves as a proof of concept for a different application for a chat messaging service such as Discord which allows for users to create “Bot Applications”.
            <br><br>
            Display:<br><br>
            There will be a textbox to serve as a terminal for players to read information about the current situation or previous events. Above the textbox will be a small display window that will serve as the main interaction window. Interactions will include choosing a path/room, seeing the combat situation or reviewing player choices.
            It is currently unclear at this time whether the player cards will be viewed within the display window or as a separate row or element.<br>
            Text descriptions will be the main information provider.
            <br><br>
            Gameplay:<br><br>
            This is a primarily click/press only interaction medium. It will consist of choosing paths through risk-reward measures.
            The meat of the project will stem from creating the card, enemy and room data followed by integrating those into retrievable information through the back-end code.

THIS IS WHERE THE TERMINAL IS. THE TEXT WILL BE LARGER IN THE FUTURE.
INFORMATION WILL BE DISPLAYED LIKE SO:
{PLAYER} HAS DEALT 250 DAMAGE TO {TARGET}
