        <p>Typically I like to have a schedule set, but if I don't keep up then things go horribly. I rushed this very assignment and submitted it just recently.<br>If I see a due date, I usually plan around submitting before. Though my hubris can get the best of me if I think that the assignment is very simple and become very lazy.</p>
