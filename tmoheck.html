        <h2><a href="index.html">Jeremy Tran</a><br>CS202 - Assignment 1</h2><br>
        <p>I took a break from Western when the COVID-19 pandemic hit and I really didn't like the online class format. My dad wasn't too fond of me doing "nothing" while I was home, so he put me on a small project.<br>The project was a full-stack project that involved an SQL server and practicing HTML and CSS front end. <br>I was already interested in Computer Science and programming before so this project kept me busy and allowed me to practice more skills.<br>This also led into my dad and uncle prodding me to submit a resume to T-Mobile (they were looking for hires).<br>Alongside this, I wrote up an idea for a patent that could be applied to telecommunications (explanation is long-winded and a bit techy).<br>The patent was born from my interest in multiplayer games and about how those games manage multiple clients. My internship at T-Mobile ended earlier this year.</p><br>
