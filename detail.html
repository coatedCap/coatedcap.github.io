            I usually like being detailed oriented, but if I'm rushing, I will make sure that I'm at least meeting the minimum requirements. This tends to lead to very uneventful and abbreviated works like this shortset of webpages. I typically don't share a lot about myself as I don't feel like the actions/tasks I complete are interesting . However, when I get going on topics like <a href="videogame.html">videogames</a>, I usually have a lot to say especially if I'm interested in the topic or am knowledgable about them.
